# Plan

## Goal & scope

Make OpenGraphMemory usable from Claude Code, OpenCode, Hermes through MCP. Ship one thin, project-scoped stdio bridge over core REST.

## Key decisions

1. Core REST only. No direct database, vector, graph, or object-store access.
2. One MCP server serves all harnesses.
3. Stdio transport first.
4. One bridge instance maps to one core project.
5. Core auth uses `X-API-Key` plus `X-Project-Id`.
6. Keep seven 0.1.0 tools: health, list datasets, query, search memory, create session, remember, upload document.
7. Reads and personal-safe writes ship; destructive tools do not.
8. MCP output uses common envelope with provenance and warnings.
9. Bridge owns SQLite session mapping and provisioned identity state; core lacks session/message list endpoints.
10. `create_session` auto-provisions user and agent; `remember` writes facts through message batch.
11. Search memory is lexical; preserve core citations and do not overstate recall quality.

## Milestones

### B0 — Foundation

Deliverables:

- Repo scaffold and `pyproject.toml` using uv.
- Config loader from environment and `.env`.
- Async HTTP client with dual-header auth, timeout, bounded retry.
- Error taxonomy and safe error mapper.
- Structured stderr logging, secret redaction.
- CI: ruff, mypy, pytest.

Exit criteria:

- `uv run` imports package and loads validated config.
- Client sends both auth headers on project calls.
- Tests prove API key redaction and error mapping.
- CI passes ruff, mypy, pytest.

### B1 — MCP read tools — complete

Implemented: stdio MCP server; hardcoded read permissions; `ogm_health`,
`ogm_list_datasets`, `ogm_query`, and `ogm_search_memory`; common success
response envelope; safe structured tool errors; unit and mock-core contract
tests. `ogm_search_memory` warns that core search is lexical.

Deliverables:

- Stdio MCP server.
- `ogm_health`, `ogm_list_datasets`, `ogm_query`, `ogm_search_memory`.
- Common response envelope and read permission checks.

Exit criteria:

- MCP Inspector completes `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`.
- Inspector calls all four read tools against mock core.
- Query preserves citations and retrieval trace.

### B2 — Session + write tools

Deliverables:

- SQLite state store.
- Resolve identity recovery prerequisite: add/verify core user-agent lookup/upsert endpoints, or define and test SQLite backup/restore as an explicit compatibility limitation.
- `ogm_create_session` with auto-provision user/agent.
- `ogm_remember`, `ogm_upload_document`.
- Hardcoded personal-safe permission allowlist.

Exit criteria:

- End-to-end: create session → remember → query with `memory_*` works.
- SQLite restores mapping after bridge restart.
- Identity provisioning remains idempotent after normal restart; state-loss behavior is documented and tested.
- Disallowed destructive operation has no registered tool/call path.

### B3 — Harness adapters

Status: implemented.

Deliverables:

- `examples/claude-code/.mcp.json.example` and `docs/claude-code.md`.
- `examples/opencode/opencode.json.example` and `docs/opencode.md`.
- `examples/hermes/config.yaml.example` and `docs/hermes.md`.
- Harness examples use all bridge-required environment variables and no secrets.
- Lightweight conformance test validates JSON examples, Hermes YAML shape, commands, env names, docs, and seven-tool expectation.

Exit criteria:

- Claude Code, OpenCode, Hermes each document calls to `ogm_query` and `ogm_search_memory`.
- Examples use environment variables, never committed secrets.
- Runtime harness verification requires user OGM credentials and remains local-only.

### B4 — Contract tests + conformance — complete

Implemented: broad mock-core conformance tests, response-close/error/retry checks,
deep query preservation, scope/default checks, project partition coverage, upload
root and symlink restrictions, seven MCP schemas, safe unexpected errors, and an
optional isolated real-core smoke test. See [conformance](conformance.md).

Deliverables:

- Unit tests: config, redaction, permissions.
- Contract tests against mock core API.
- Optional integration suite against real core container.
- Conformance scenarios: auth error, unknown project, citation preserved, memory scope, remember needs permission, duplicate document, timeout mapping.

Exit criteria:

- Contract suite asserts methods, paths, headers, request fields, constraints, response mapping.
- Every listed scenario passes.
- Real-core suite runs when integration environment enabled.

### B5 — Packaging

Deliverables:

- `pyproject.toml` console entry point, runnable through `uvx`.
- Versioning policy and dependency pins.
- Release/install docs.

Exit criteria:

- Clean machine command runs bridge with `uvx`.
- Version appears in package and release docs.
- Install docs work for all three harnesses.

## Deferred to later versions

0.2+: cross-harness session sync; automatic conversation ingestion with secret filtering; manifest generator; full permission-policy engine; OpenClaw plugin; destructive tools; HTTP MCP transport.

## First implementation steps

1. Create uv `pyproject.toml`, `src` package, test layout, ruff/mypy/pytest config.
2. Add typed config. Require base URL, API key, project ID; load `.env`; set timeout/retry/state defaults.
3. Add stderr structured logger and recursive secret redactor. Test no key leaks.
4. Add error classes: auth, not-found, validation, payload-too-large, unsupported-media, upstream, timeout, transport, permission.
5. Build async `httpx` client. Normalize base URL. Send both headers. Set timeout. Retry only retryable failures.
6. Build contract-test mock core. Assert route, headers, payload, mapped errors.
7. Add minimal stdio MCP server and common result/error envelope.
8. Implement B1 in tool order: health, datasets, query, search memory.
9. Run MCP Inspector exit flow before B2.
10. Add SQLite migrations/store, then B2 tools and permission allowlist.
